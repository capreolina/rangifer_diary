# rangifer’s diary: pt. i

I’ve never tried doing a MapleStory diary, but since I’ve just started a new character, I figured I’d give it a go ^^. This will be a diary for **rangifer**, the [pugilist](https://oddjobs.codeberg.page/odd-jobs.html#pugilist)! The first entry is very short (barely its own entry), so both the first and second entries will be condensed into this post.

The character is created… and her name shall be [**`rangifer`**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangifer) 🦌.

And so it is.

rangifer is shaping up nicely~! Been leveling up with fellow Oddjobs member **Boymoder** (Kelsey) the [STRlord](https://oddjobs.codeberg.page/odd-jobs.html#str-assassin), who is also in the guild with her F/P [gishlet](https://oddjobs.codeberg.page/odd-jobs.html#luk-gish) **Tacgnol**, and her [permabeginner](https://oddjobs.codeberg.page/odd-jobs.html#permabeginner) **Taima**!

Here I am at level 17 doing Nautilus Harbour 🚢 quests (and looking kinda moody)…

![Level 17 rangifer](./rangifer-level-17.png "Level 17 rangifer")

Once we hit level 21, we headed off to Kerning City!… to do [Shumi’s Lost Coin](https://bbb.hidden-street.net/quest/victoria-island/shumis-lost-coin) 🔎🪙. Let’s just say that Kelsey is a little more experienced with JQs than I am 😅…

Once that quest was done, it was the greatest time of all: KPQ time! We did quite a number of KPQs, with some very nice people, in some large (5–6 person) parties 🥳. Boymoder has been finding her claw to actually be quite useful, so we almost had people fooled that we were just a normal brawler-to-be and assassin-to-be, at least until Boymoder pulled out the ol’ [Gold Surfboard](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01442029) 🏄. As an aside, readers unfamiliar with [STRlords](https://oddjobs.codeberg.page/odd-jobs.html#str-assassin) should know that using a claw during first job means basic attacking, *not* using [Lucky Seven](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=4001344), because Lucky Seven has its own special-sauce damage formula that is very, very bad for STRlords 😕!

At some point, most people decided it was time to take a break, so Boymoder and I took a break too, and chatted with a level 82 white knight ♘ in Kerning City who seemed mildly surprised that seasoned MapleLegends players would go and make some crappy odd-jobbed characters 😛. Also, Boymoder took this opportunity to scroll a sweet **59 WATK [Monkey Wrench](https://maplelegends.com/lib/equip?id=01422004) 🔧**, which is her main melee weapon for now! The Monkey Wrench is a classic weapon for [woodmen](https://oddjobs.codeberg.page/odd-jobs.html#woodsman), [brigands](https://oddjobs.codeberg.page/odd-jobs.html#brigand), and of course STRlords, due to it being equippable not just by warriors, but also by archers and by rogues~

Then our friend **NoobIet** (`Noobiet`), the [dagger warrior](https://oddjobs.codeberg.page/odd-jobs.html#dagger-warrior) 🗡️🛡️, logged on! And he was level 21, so it was time to KPQ!! Thus commenced *the first-ever all-Oddjobs PQ 🍏:*

You can actually [watch the full PQ on the Oddjobs YouTube channel 📽️](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPRW9Hj6rN4)!

We did a few PQs together as an odd-jobbed trio, and then it was ta-ta for now! rangifer made it from level 2 to level 27 in a single session, wowie!! I aspire to some day make it to third job so I can [transform](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=5111005), and do [that cool ground pounding thing](https://maplelegends.com/lib/skill?id=5111006)! We’ll see~~ ✨
