# Footnote sigils in rangifer’s diary

I often make use of footnotes within my diary entries. However, because the
MapleLegends forums (which I — perhaps begrudgingly — continue to crosspost to)
don’t support superscripts/subscripts (among many, many other things, including
any Unicode codepoints that cannot be encoded with a single UTF-16 codeunit…),
I started using sigils like asterisks (\*) to make references to footnotes,
instead of the usual superscript numerals like this<sup>\[1\]</sup>.

The problem is that one asterisk only takes you so far. So here is a list, **in
order**, of the sigils that I use:

| sigil | codepoint | name                               |
| ----- | --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| \*    | U+002a    | asterisk                           |
| †     | U+2020    | dagger                             |
| ‡     | U+2021    | double dagger                      |
| ⸸     | U+2e38    | turned dagger                      |
| ¶     | U+00b6    | pilcrow sign                       |
| ※     | U+203b    | reference mark                     |
| ❦     | U+2766    | floral heart                       |
| ⁂     | U+2042    | asterism                           |
| ☟     | U+261f    | white down pointing index          |
| ◊     | U+25ca    | lozenge                            |
| ⧆     | U+29c6    | squared asterisk                   |
| ✤     | U+2724    | heavy four balloon-spoked asterisk |
| ➿    | U+27bf    | double curly loop                  |
| ☛     | U+261b    | black right pointing index         |

Fun, right…?

Notice that I don’t use the triple dagger (U+2e4b), despite using the single
(U+2020) and double (U+2021) daggers. This is because font support for U+2e4b
is virtually nonexistent, outside of like one random font made specifically for
ancient scripts that isn’t even
[free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_content). &#x1f644;
